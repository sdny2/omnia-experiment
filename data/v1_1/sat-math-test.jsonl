{"passage": "", "question": "If $\\frac{x-1}{3}=k$ and $k=3$, what is the value of $x ?$", "options": ["(A)2", "(B)4", "(C)9", "(D)10"], "label": "D", "other": {"solution": "Choice D is correct. Since $k=3$, one can substitute 3 for $k$ in the equation $\\frac{x-1}{3}=k$, which gives $\\frac{x-1}{3}=3$. Multiplying both sides of $\\frac{x-1}{3}=3$ by 3 gives $x-1=9$ and then adding 1 to both sides of $x-1=9$ gives $x=10$.Choices $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}$, and $\\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect because the result of subtracting 1 from the value and dividing by 3 is not the given value of $k$, which is 3 ."}}
